<p>As a spike, I took some time to upgrade my vim&#39;s plugins and fix lint in the blog repo. I decided to try <a href="https://prettier.io/">prettier</a> so I could devote less time to thinking about config files. And I landed on <a href="https://github.com/w0rp/ale">Ale</a> after being unsatisfied with the user-friendliness of neomake. Ale allows you to run general purpose linters and fixers in vim.</p>
<p>Prettier is lovely since it automatically fixes files as you save them. For additional error visibility, I added some additional linters, since the prettier+Ale combo doesn&#39;t seem to bother showing you errors in your html and css (it silently fixes them on save, but that&#39;s all). I&#39;d prefer to see the errors before they get autofixed, so I added stylelint with stylelint-prettier for my css and htmlhint for html. Throught the process I was impressed by Ale&#39;s ability to &quot;just work&quot;, and even provide helpful errors.</p>
<p>Installing styelint was easy, but to get extensions and plugins working was a pain - I needed to specify the absolute paths for each. I should have just immediately accepted this and moved on, but I have a bad habit of obsessively trying to find out what I did wrong when this sort of hacky thing pops up (for fear that it is a symptom of a more serious issue). Ultimately I wasn&#39;t successful removing the absolute paths, but since things are working, it&#39;s not a big deal. This was a good reminder that sometimes you should just &quot;make it work&quot; and move on.</p>
