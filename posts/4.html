      <p>This story was simple: add links to the articles from the home page.</p>
      
      <h2>Retrospective</h2>

      <p>vim Snipmate has problems with backtick characters. This is an issue for writing js snippets with template strings. Added a spike story to investigate workarounds and alternatives. Snipmate is old, maybe it's time to find a more modern tool. But I should check if there's an escape character before I try out a new shiny tool I don't need.</p>

      <p>In the spirit of kaizen, I realized I could save a few seconds by adding a bookmark to TestCafe's docs in my bookmarks bar. Obvious, but viewing this as part of the agile process is new to me.</p>

      <p>If I remember correctly, TestCafe does not allow plugins such as Mocha for assertions, which is too bad, since I'm likely to write "toContain" instead of "contains" frequently. Not a big deal though.</p>

      <p>This blog post was short and not very interesting. I will be more strict going forwards, not every story's retro is worthy of a post.</p>
