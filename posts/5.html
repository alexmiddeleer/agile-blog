    <h1>Agile Blog</h1>
    <article>
      <div class="publishDate">April 2019</div>

<p>The MVP is now done. It&#39;s extemely crude, but it also has some endearing features - no javascript, friendly to screen readers, and a tiny payload. It also has a few lines of css to make it readible, if not visually stunning. We haven&#39;t even broken the back button :-)</p>
<p>We should definitely provide a navbar or at least a home button as soon as possible, but the blog is technically fully functional in my opinion.</p>
<p>Having finished the barebones mvp, I decided to do a refactor. The articles are not DRY, so I decided to do a spike to see if I could build a simple &quot;compile-time&quot; article templater.</p>
<p>The end result is workable. To reduce verbosity, I threw in a markdown converter lib. Now our app has two dependencies (two classics - <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/marked">marked</a> and <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/mustache">mustache</a>), but happily they are dev-only - our users still won&#39;t need to download any javascript. Don&#39;t get me wrong, javascript is great, but forcing our users to download scripts when they&#39;re completely unnecessary isn&#39;t very thoughtful.</p>

<p>I used strict tdd to build the article templater. I also wrote tiny methods with descriptive names to keep things simple and readible. This took a while, but at the very least it adheres to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KISS_principle">KISS principle</a>. Additionally, the result looks easy to upgrade and extend. I still need to go back and do a final naming refactor and file reorganization, and update the README.md.</p>
<p>I suspect the templater is not a permanent solution, but it was a useful kata at least. It definitely feels like one of the smallest possible solutions, and as such didn&#39;t require serious planning. At the end of this project, it will be interesting to reflect on whether there are real benefits to extreme programming with a &quot;naive&quot; and minimal approach like this (though I probably won&#39;t have enough data yet, admittedly).</p>
