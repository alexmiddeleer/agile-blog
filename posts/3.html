<h2>
  Creating some posts
</h2>

<p>The next step was to write some posts. I started with bare html. I knew this was likely to reveal some major inefficiencies, but that is part of the lean process as I understand it.</p>

<p>I haven't even added links to these posts yet, but they're available at /posts/X.html (X = 1, 2, or 3)</p>

<h2>Retrospective</h2>

<p>The only "problem" I ran into was the project structure. I knew I wanted the URL to be of the form /posts/title.html, but this would require a posts directory in the root directory. Either that, or using a feature of Github pages that I am not aware of. Since I didn't want to do a big build buildout yet or invest much time learning GitHub pages features, I decided to merge the src directory into the root directory. When the project structure gets too messy I'll restructure.</p>

<p>Converting Google Docs pages to html was a pain (and dangerous, since it's easy to forget to recreate links), so I'll try writing post drafts in plain html directly.</p>

<p>Copying the page templates across files was not DRY or efficient, so as soon as I finish this blog's mvp, I will probably add some features like templating or markdown rendering</p>

<p>Starting a new project is hard. The amount of time I invested in reading about e2e testing tools was probably excessive. I was unhappy that I had to manually rerun test cafe with ctrl-r, but I'm not sure it was worth reading about cypress and jsdom for a couple of hours to fix this (at least in the short term). Should be more disciplined about not doing ad-hoc spikes. Instead, I'll list the things I want to improve or research and do proper spikes in order of priority. <a href="https://xkcd.com/1205/">This XKCD on time saved automating a task comes to mind</a>. Perhaps it would have been worthwhile if I was planning to work on this blog for several years.
</p>

<p>It was interesting that I already had to change the project structure. I assumed picking github pages would be essentially free, but it wasn't. I could go read the docs on github pages about how to make the home page not live in the root directory, but I am not sure that becoming a GP expert is something I'd like to do. Perhaps deploying to Amazon S3 would have been a better idea. Adding that as a possible spike.</p>

<p>Turns out css was broken on the live site. Another unexpected issue with github pages pertains to absolute url paths. I had my link pointing to /blog.css, but <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/52003059/752916">this post</a> explains the problem with that.</p>
