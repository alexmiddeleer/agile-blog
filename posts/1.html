    <h1>Agile Blog</h1>
    <article>
      <div class="publishDate">April 2019</div>

<p>Hi visitor, my name is Alex Middeleer. I am a web developer. You have found what I am calling my agile blog, and I hope you enjoy it.</p>
<p>The purpose of this blog is to try out and practice work methodologies that my team has been learning this week at Wolters Kluwer with the help of Tim Ottinger. Although I am working on this on my own for personal enjoyment, I can still practice continuous deployment and test-driven development, even if I can&#39;t practice mob/pair programming and other &quot;lean&quot; practices that assume n &gt; 1 team members. So the goal right now is simple: build a blog and write articles about the process. I may revisit this goal later.</p>
<p>I will start with a story map. First I will write an introduction to what it is, then I will actually create it, and then I will write a retrospective. Frequent retrospectives will be another feature of this blog, since they seem like a key feature of agile and could be interesting blog material. This (or anything else) could change, however, in the name of experimentation or improving the project flow.</p>
<p>A story map is a fun way to plan a projects&#39; stages. It is particularly good at quickly isolating important pieces that should be delivered first. It may be more of a teaching tool than a practical one, but I thought it was valuable enough that I want to try it out for the blog. In essence, you first list everything you could possibly want given a large budget. Then you tweak the list given a budget half that size (by modifying or cutting features). You repeat until you are satisfied that a lower budget would yield nothing of value worth delivering.</p>
<p>Alternatively, instead of just halving your budget, you can divide up the features into delivery stages that make sense for your project. For example, features A, B, and C are all bare necessities, so we need them for the first stage. Features D and E add a lot of benefit, and are co-dependent, so they will be deployed together in stage 2. The other features are nice to have but not necessary, so they will be released in stage 3, or perhaps not at all (if the budget runs out).</p>
<p>To me, grouping stories together in stages doesn&#39;t completely make sense in the context of extreme continuous deployment, which I interpret to mean &quot;ship everything to production as soon as possible, ideally after each commit with passing tests&quot;. However, even extreme programming can benefit from a structure for prioritization, which story mapping seems to provide nicely.</p>
<p>##Follow Up and Retrospective</p>
<p>###After writing story map</p>
<p>Here is a link to the “finished” story map: <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/alexmiddeleer/agile-blog/master/doc/story-map.md">Link to github</a></p>
<p>Overall, the plain text story map (normally you do this with sticky notes on a wall and a group of people) worked okay. It’s ugly, but usable. The biggest issue was lack of peers coming up with ideas - the group brainstorm aspect of the story mapping process seems much more likely to produce creative and comprehensive feature sets. So not having a team is especially painful for this step.</p>
<p>Another note: today we discussed about kaizen, the process of continually making the process slightly better (or at least a little bit better each day).  This made me want to improve my vim skills a bit every day - I admit I have been lax in this regard, having gotten fairly comfortable with the editor. I realized I should get better with fugitive, a powerful vim git plugin. I also realized there must be a way to <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/23314320/vim-macros-insert-mode">end a macro in insert mode</a>. I have resolved to (re)read the docs for these tools more slowly and adopt the vim best practice of trying not to hit the same key more than a could of times. A shout out to Lucas F. Costa for his great <a href="https://lucasfcosta.com/2019/02/10/terminal-guide-2019.html">article</a> that mentions this.</p>
<p>Next I will work on the title. This will require creating infrastructure for deployment and testing.</p>
