Alex Middeleer's Blog-as-a-Kata. This is not a fully fleshed out
professional blog. My goal is to practice tdd and experiment with some
extreme programming. The blog posts themselves are mostly retrospectives
for the sake of kata. Please find me on
<a href="https://twitter.com/AlexMiddeleer">Twitter</a> if you want to
drop me a note. Have a great day!
