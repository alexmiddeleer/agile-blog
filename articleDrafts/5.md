The MVP is now done. It's extemely crude, but it also has some endearing features - no javascript, friendly to screen readers, and a tiny payload. It also has a few lines of css to make it readible, if not visually stunning. We haven't even broken the back button :-)

We should definitely provide a navbar or at least a home button as soon as possible, but the blog is technically fully functional in my opinion.

Having finished the barebones mvp, I decided to do a refactor. The articles are not DRY, so I decided to do a spike to see if I could build a simple "compile-time" article templater.

The end result is workable. To reduce verbosity, I threw in a markdown converter lib. Now our app has two dependencies (two classics - [marked](https://www.npmjs.com/package/marked) and [mustache](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mustache)), but happily they are dev-only - our users still won't need to download any javascript. Don't get me wrong, javascript is great, but forcing our users to download scripts when they're completely unnecessary isn't very thoughtful.

## Retrospective

I used strict tdd to build the article templater. I also wrote tiny methods with descriptive names to keep things simple and readible. This took a while, but at the very least it adheres to the [KISS principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KISS_principle). Additionally, the result looks easy to upgrade and extend. I still need to go back and do a final naming refactor and file reorganization, and update the README.md.

I suspect the templater is not a permanent solution, but it was a useful kata at least. It definitely feels like one of the smallest possible solutions, and as such didn't require serious planning. At the end of this project, it will be interesting to reflect on whether there are real benefits to extreme programming with a "naive" and minimal approach like this (though I probably won't have enough data yet, admittedly).
